My research so far has focused on investigating the Earthâ€™s paleomagnetic field on timescales ranging from hundreds to millions of years, with the underlying goal to connect the morphology of the magnetic field to geodynamo processes.

I am a graduate student at Scripps Institution of Oceanography, studying Earth's magnetic field in the past.

I am still working on my personal research page.
